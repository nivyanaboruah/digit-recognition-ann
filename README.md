# Digit Recognition Using ANN 🔢

This project implements a simple **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** using the MNIST dataset to recognize handwritten digits (0–9). Built with TensorFlow and Keras, it demonstrates how neural networks interpret image data and make predictions.

## 📁 Files

- `MNIST_ann_project.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code and explanations.

## Model Overview

- **Dataset**: [MNIST Handwritten Digits](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
- **Model**: Artificial Neural Network 
- **Libraries Used**: `TensorFlow`, `Keras`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Sklearn`
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy Score, Confusion Matrix, Visual Prediction Samples

##  Steps Performed

1. Loaded and preprocessed MNIST data
2. Built and trained the ANN model
3. Evaluated model using a confusion matrix
4. Visualized predictions for sample digits

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nivyanaboruah/digit-recognition-ann.git

## Learnings
This project was a great introduction to:

Deep learning with ANN

Image classification

Data visualization and evaluation
